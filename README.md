# bagels_guessing_game
Bagels guessing game, where program generates a random 3 digits combination and the human has 10 guesses to correctly guess the digits and their order.

Guessing the right digit in wrong position "Pico". Right digit in right position prints "Fermi". If none of the guessed digits are correct prints "Bagels"

## Example

Bagels, a deductive logic game

I am thinking of a 3 digit number with no repeated digits.
Try guess what it is. Here are some clues:
When I say:      That means:
   Pico          One digis is correct but in the wrong position.
   Fermi         One digit is correct and in the right position.
   Bagels        No digit is correct.

For example, if the secret number was 248 and your guess was 843, the
clues would be Fermi Pico.
I have thought up a number.
